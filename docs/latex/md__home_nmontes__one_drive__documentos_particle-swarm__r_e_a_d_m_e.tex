Implementation of the \mbox{\hyperlink{class_particle}{Particle}} \mbox{\hyperlink{class_swarm}{Swarm}} Optimization algorithm in bounded spaces without additional constraints. Suitable for optimization over continuous subspaces. For a review of the algorithm, please refer to \href{https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0122827}{\texttt{ Ab Wahab {\itshape et al.} 2015}}.
