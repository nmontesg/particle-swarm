# Particle Swarm Optimization

Implementation of the Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm in bounded spaces without additional constraints. Suitable for optimization over subspaces of $\mathbb{R}^n$. For a review of the algorithm, please refer to [Ab Wahab _et al._ 2015](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0122827).
